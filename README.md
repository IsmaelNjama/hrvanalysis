This project implements the most known heart rate variability analysis techniques (Frequency and Time domains as well as nonlinear parameters ) with Django using the [pyhrv link](https://github.com/PGomes92/pyhrv/blob/master/README.md) tool for background heart rate analysis.



# Basic usage

After registering the users are able to:
* Add subjects to their study board
* Upload HRV marker files(supported by pyhrv) of their subjects and run the analysis
* Compare and export their subject data to pdf reports.
